# Conada

Conada is a VR game, designed using Unity game engine, to test the independent functionality of our two distinct cortical visual pathways (i.e. the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream), based on Goodale's idea, but using the *contour adaptation* illusion and in a VR setup.

# The Report
## Idea
This unity experiment is based on the Goodale's papers. Goodale discusses the two different visual paths in the human brain, that is the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream, and argues that the image processing tasks happening in these two pathways act as independent as their phyisical separation. In other words, he argues that while we act based on the visual information coming through the dorsal path, our perception is based on the information coming through the ventral path. And these two pathways might carry different interpretations of the world.
