# Conada (under construction...)

Conada is a VR game, designed using Unity game engine, to test the independent functionality of our two distinct cortical visual pathways (i.e. the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream), based on Goodale's idea, but using the *contour adaptation* illusion and in a VR setup.
