# Conada

Conada is a VR game, designed using Unity game engine, to test the independent functionality of our two distinct cortical visual pathways (i.e. the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream), based on Goodale's idea, but using the *contour adaptation* illusion and in a VR setup.

# The Report
## Idea
This unity experiment is based on the Goodale's papers. Goodale discusses the two different visual paths in the human brain, that is the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream, and argues that the image processing tasks happening in these two pathways act as independent as their phyisical separation. In other words, he argues that while we act based on the visual information coming through the dorsal path, our perception is based on the information coming through the ventral path. And these two pathways might carry different interpretations of the world.
In his papers, Goodale employed visual illusions to prove his point. The basic experiment introduced by him is to ask the subjects to judge about the length of two pieces of shaded paper by showing their sizes with their fingers, *and* also try to actually pick the longer one. These two pieces of papers and the experiment settings by using different techniques like shading, drawing parallel, and making impression of perspective creates visual illusions that mislead subjects to believe a length difference, while the papers share the same length. According to him, in the first task subjects process visual information throught the perception path, while in the latter one, through the action path. And if their judgement about the length difference proves inconsistent, that means the independence of the two pathways. His experiment showed that participant judgements differs based on the task they were doing, so he concluded the independence of two paths' functionality.
