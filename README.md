# Conada

Conada is a VR game, designed using Unity game engine, to test the independent functionality of our two distinct cortical visual pathways (i.e. the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream), based on Goodale's idea, but using the *contour adaptation* illusion and in a VR setup.

# The Report
## Idea
This unity experiment is based on the Goodale's papers. Goodale discusses the two different visual paths in the human brain, that is the dorsal action stream and the ventral perception stream, and argues that the image processing tasks happening in these two pathways act as independent as their phyisical separation. In other words, he argues that while we act based on the visual information coming through the dorsal path, our perception is based on the information coming through the ventral path. And these two pathways might carry different interpretations of the world.<br><br>
In his papers, Goodale employed visual illusions to prove his point. The basic experiment introduced by him is to ask the subjects to judge about the length of two pieces of shaded paper by showing their sizes with their fingers, *and* also try to actually pick the longer one. These two pieces of papers and the experiment settings by using different techniques like shading, drawing parallel, and making impression of perspective creates visual illusions that mislead subjects to believe a length difference, while the papers share the same length. According to him, in the first task subjects process visual information throught the perception path, while in the latter one, through the action path. And if their judgement about the length difference proves inconsistent, that means the independence of the two pathways. His experiment showed that participant judgements differs based on the task they were doing, so he concluded the independence of two paths' functionality.
<br>
<br>Though, there are controversies about his results and some other researchers claimed that the replication of his experiment showed no meaningful judgement inconsistency or some interpreted the inconsistency not as a direct result of independent functionality of two paths.
<br>
<br>
So, the idea behind Conada game-experiment was to replicate the same experiment, but in VR environment which seems to have greater potentials for setting the stage for a visual illusion.<br><br>
Conada is a try to construct the [**Con**tour **ada**ptation illusion](https://michaelbach.de/ot/lum-contourAdapt/index.html) in VR environment.<br>
The first 5 minutes of Conada is a first player shooter game to familiarize the subject with an enemy named *Looloo spider*. the player/subjects need to fight (by shooting to spiders) or flight (by running away from them) in order to keep alive for 5 minutes. The reason behind this stage was to condition the subject/player to be alarmed by seeing a Looloo spider and decide to act fast, almost reflectively. In way that their reaction to recognizing Looloo spider become mostly relied on the ventral/motion visual path.
If the subject/player loses all of their 5 hearts, they will directed to the death scene, from where they can either exit the experiment or repeat it.<br>
If the subject/player manage to stay alive for 5 minutes they will be directed to the experiment guide scene where they can read the instructions for the experiment. Upon they agreement to doing the experiment, they can either exit or press the 'Ready!' button and start the experiment.<br>
<br>
During the experiment the subject will be asked to do the *contour adaptation* task, but with shadows of two Looloo spiders. One shadow will disappear at the end of the experiment, while flickers stop and the player/subject is instructed to shoot the remaining one without deviating their eyes from the fixation points. The experiment will be repeated multiple times. And the result will be recorded.
<br>The assumption is that if the participant shoot the right side of the screen for too many trials to be considered random (regarding the p-value), it means that the dorsal path is functioning independent from the ventral one.

## Grade
First of all, I'm very proud of the idea behind this project, that is, implementing visual illusions in VR. VR has great potentials for testing the weaknesses of human brain. And I did not find many researches on using VR for 'brain hack,' so to say. Therefore, I'll give myself a straight A (1.0) for this part.
<br><br>
Another strong part of my work is that is relied on scientific studies..
<br><br>But with the implementation, I had problems. Though, since it was more about the experiment rather than VR-technicality, I guess I deserve a shiny 1.0.
