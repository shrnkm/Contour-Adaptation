We could have a 'fight-or-flight' rooms for creating ghost-demons attacking the subject, so when they adapt to the 'fight-or-flight' conditions of the room, we use the [Contour Adaptation](https://michaelbach.de/ot/lum-contourAdapt/index.html) illusions for one remained devil.<br/>
<br>
After the subject focused on a fixation point for a, say, 10 sec, the contours will disappear and we also remove one of the ghost demons. Based on contour adaptation effect for a short while the user is not able to see even the one remained ghost, but if dorsal pathway is woring well, especially under the pressure of 'fight-or-flight' condition, it should be able to signal the remained one to the user motor system and they must shoot the right one.<br/>
<br>
The only thing that make me uncomfortable for now is if the elaborate picture of a demon (that should be scary anyway!) would fit for the ghost patch in this illusion.<br/>
I have to test it, it must be quite simple and I don't even need to work with unity at this point.
